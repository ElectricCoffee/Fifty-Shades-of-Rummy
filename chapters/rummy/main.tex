\chapter{Rummy Family}
Somewhat unhelpfully, the \textit{main} family of rummy games, is simply referred to as ``Rummy'', and comes in a wide variety of flavours all to themselves.

These flavours can be generally divided into the following sub-categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Standard
    \item Knocking
    \item Contract
    \item Recombining
\end{itemize}
