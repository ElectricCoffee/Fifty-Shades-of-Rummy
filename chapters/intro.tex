\chapter*{Introduction}
Rummy is a great vast family of board- and card games, spanning the likes of European Rummy, to Rummikub, to Mahjong.

This book aims to summarise the rules of these games not by their similarities, but instead by their differences. Starting with a foundational basic Rummy that contains most of the base rules common across all the variants, and then summarising the other games in terms of that.

The sections of the book will be grouped logically in such a way as to minimise the amounts of major deviations from section to section.
